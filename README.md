# Save_The_Tower
I Have created this game using pure java.
So as the name says "SAVE THE TOWER" Here in the game
you have to save your kingdom's main from enemies.
So as the Game starts you will get to see a GUI interface
with 4 options Play, Edit(For Editing the game's map), settings & Quit.
The main characters of this game are:- 1. Wizard,   2. Archer,   3. Cannon
The cost of an Archer is 30G,  The cost of a Wizard is 45G, and The cost of Cannon is 65G
Here G stands for gold
and there is a total of 10 enemies including The King of Enemies.
The King is the strongest one and if the king dies "HURRAY" You won the game.
the libraries I have used here are AWT ToolKit, Jframe, Jlabel, KeyListener, MouseListener ETC.
The whole Code of this game is available on my GitHub
